# My Project: MyHospitalManager

## What is it about?
The application I am designing is a hospital management application.

## Who is this intended for?
This application is intended for use by hospital personnel.

I find this project fascinating because I went into Computer Science with the intent of pursuing bioinformatics.
Ever since I was young, I have been interested in the field of medicine, largely due to the fact that my parents
studied medicine while they were in college. As such, I feel like this term project is a way to bridge my two passions
and pursue my interests further.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to log in using a system-wide username and password.
- As a user, I wish to be able to book appointments in and out of the system.
- As a user, I wish to be able to generate a list of inquiries made to the Help Desk.
- As a user, I wish to be able to generate a list of all doctors currently employed at the Hospital.
- As a user, I wish to be able to check patients in and out of the system.
- As a user, I wish to be able to input medical records into the system.
- As a user, I wish to be able to save the current state of the program to file (more specifically 
currently checked-in patients,  medical records, and booked appointments).
- As a user, I wish to be given the option to load the previous state of my program.

##Looking Back

Looking back on my UML diagram, if I had more time to refactor the code, I would refactor my design in the following
ways: 
- Move the lists of data above in the hierarchy right under MainMenu, so that it could be a focal point of control
- Integrate the list of appointments, doctors, medical records, patients, and inquiries directly into their menu 
classes, to increase cohesion and reduce coupling.
- This one feels a bit unrealistic, but have main menu implement the writable interface (or an interface with similar
functionality) so that all its subclasses could freely implement the toJson() methods without complicating the design
further.
